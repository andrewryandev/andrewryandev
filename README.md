### Hi there 👋

I'm a technical support officer currently working for the NSW Government 👔

Investigating and solving problems is in my DNA 🧬

I'm aspiring to follow my passions and make the hop across the pond to become a full-time developer 👨‍💻

Here you'll find a few things I've worked on in my job and also some fun projects too while I learn different languages 🎓

Thanks for dropping by and having gander at my profile. Feel free to chat anytime (LinkedIn below)! 🙋‍♂️
